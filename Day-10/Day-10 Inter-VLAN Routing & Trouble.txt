Day-10: Inter-VLAN Routing & Troubleshooting Lab

Objective:
Troubleshoot and resolve misconfigurations in a multi-router network to establish connectivity between two PCs (PC1 and PC2) across three different subnets.

Network Overview:
• PC1 (192.168.1.1/24) is connected via Switch SW1 to Router R1 on G0/1 (192.168.1.254).
• PC2 (192.168.3.1/24) is connected via Switch SW2 to Router R2 on G0/1 (192.168.3.254).
• R1 G0/0 (192.168.12.1) is connected to R2 G0/0 (192.168.12.2).
• R2 G0/1 connects to SW2 and R2 G0/0 connects to R1.

Issue:
• PC1 and PC2 are unable to ping each other.
• There is one misconfiguration on each router (R1 and R2) preventing end-to-end   communication.

Tasks:
1. Analyze interface IP configurations and verify subnet match and correctness.
2. Check for routing or IP addressing errors.
3. Apply corrections on both R1 and R2.
4. Ensure successful ping between PC1 and PC2.

Success Criteria:
• Both PCs must be able to successfully ping each other after fixing router misconfigurations.
