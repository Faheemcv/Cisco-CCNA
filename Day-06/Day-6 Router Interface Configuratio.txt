Day-6: Router Interface Configuration and IP Addressing Lab

Objective:
To configure and verify router interface settings, assign IP addresses, and test end-to-end connectivity between PCs across different networks using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Lab Tasks Overview:
1. Set R1's Hostname
Rename the router for identification using the hostname command in global configuration mode.

2. View Router Interfaces (R1)
Use show ip interface brief or show interfaces to check the IP address, status (up/down), and interface details.

3. Assign IPs and Enable Interfaces on R1
•Configure IP addresses on:

• G0/0 as 15.0.0.254/8

• G0/1 as 182.98.0.254/16

• G0/2 as 201.191.20.254/24

• Use no shutdown to enable interfaces.

• Add appropriate descriptions using description command.

4. Verify Interface Configuration Again
Recheck interfaces with show ip interface brief to confirm changes.

5. Save the Configuration
Use copy running-config startup-config to save your configuration permanently.

6. Configure PC IP Addresses
Assign IPs and subnet masks:

• PC1: 15.0.0.1 / 255.255.255.0

• PC2: 182.98.0.1 / 255.255.255.0

• PC3: 201.191.20.1 / 255.255.255.0

7. Ping Test for Connectivity
Ping from PC1 to PC2 and PC3 to ensure successful routing and communication across the networks.

Learning Outcome:
By completing this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in:

• Router interface configuration

• IP addressing and subnetting

• Enabling and verifying interface status

• Testing network connectivity using ping
