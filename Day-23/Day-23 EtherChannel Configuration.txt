Day-23: EtherChannel Configuration & Load Balancing Lab

Objective:
To practice and demonstrate configuration of Layer 2 and Layer 3 EtherChannel using different negotiation protocols (LACP, PAgP, and Static) and implement load balancing strategies in a multi-switch network topology. The end goal is to ensure connectivity between hosts and server and optimize bandwidth utilization using EtherChannel load balancing.

Network Topology Overview:
ASW1 & ASW2: Access switches connected to PCs and server.

DSW1 & DSW2: Distribution layer switches forming EtherChannels with access switches.

IP Subnets:

ASW1 LAN: 172.16.1.0/24

ASW2 LAN: 172.16.2.0/24

Inter-switch Network: 10.0.0.0/30

VLAN1 SVI (Switched Virtual Interface) IPs are pre-configured on all switches with .254.

Tasks:
LACP Configuration:

Configure a Layer 2 EtherChannel between ASW1 and DSW1 using LACP (IEEE 802.3ad).

Ensure the EtherChannel is operating as a trunk link.

PAgP Configuration:

Configure a Layer 2 EtherChannel between ASW2 and DSW2 using PAgP (Cisco proprietary).

Set the link as a trunk as well.

Static EtherChannel:

Configure a Layer 3 EtherChannel between DSW1 and DSW2 using manual (static) configuration.

Routing Configuration:

Configure static or dynamic routing to enable end devices (PC1, PC2) to reach the server (SRV1) in another subnet.

Default Load Balancing Method:

Identify the default load-balancing algorithm used by switches for EtherChannel (typically src-mac).

Custom Load Balancing:

Modify the load-balancing method on switches to use source and destination IP address (src-dst-ip) for better traffic distribution.

Key Configuration Concepts:
LACP Mode: active or passive

PAgP Mode: desirable or auto

Static EtherChannel: No negotiation protocol; both ends must match manually.

Interface Port-Channel: Logical interface representing the EtherChannel group.

Trunking: Needed when carrying multiple VLANs between switches.

Routing: Either using static routes or dynamic (e.g., OSPF) to ensure PC to Server communication.

Tools Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer with devices:

2960 switches (ASW1, ASW2)

3560 switches (DSW1, DSW2)

PCs and Server connected through FastEthernet interfaces
