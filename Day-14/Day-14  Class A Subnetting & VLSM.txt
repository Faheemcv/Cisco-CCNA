Day-14 : Class A Subnetting & VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)
Class A Subnetting 

• IP Range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
• Default Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
• Supports: Very large networks (over 16 million hosts)
• Subnetting Use: Divides the huge number of hosts into smaller subnets for better management.
• Example: Using /16 creates 256 subnets, each with 65,534 hosts.

VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

• VLSM allows using different subnet sizes within the same network.
• It helps optimize IP address usage by assigning subnet masks based on exact host needs.
• Example: A subnet with 2 hosts gets /30, while another with 50 hosts gets /26.
• Used in: Real-world routing and efficient IP planning.
