Day-24: Floating Static Route Configuration & Route Failover Lab



Objective:
To understand how floating static routes provide backup paths in case of a primary route failure, and to observe the failover behavior using routing tables and testing connectivity.

Network Description:
This lab setup features:

Enterprise A Network with:

PC1 (10.0.1.10/24)

SRV1 (10.0.2.10/24) connected via switches SW1 and SW2.

Two routers: R1 and R2, both connected to ISP routers for external connectivity and redundancy.

ISP A Network using router SPR1 and ISP backbone links.

Routing Protocol:

Enterprise A uses EIGRP as its dynamic routing protocol.

Key Configuration Goals:
1. Identify Routing Protocol and Route Preference:
Check the routing tables of R1 and R2.

Determine which routing protocol is running (EIGRP is visible).

Identify:

Route used by PC1 to reach SRV1.

Route used by PC1 to access public IP 1.1.1.1 (via ISP).

Test by pinging SRV1 and 1.1.1.1 from PC1.

2. Configure Floating Static Routes (Backup Path):
Add floating static routes on R1 and R2 as backup paths in case the main link (G0/2/0) fails.

Assign higher administrative distance to these routes.

Verify if the routes are present in routing tables before failure.

These routes should not appear in the routing table as long as the main link is up.

3. Simulate Link Failure and Test Failover:
Shutdown G0/2/0 interface between R1 and R2 to simulate primary link failure.

Confirm the floating static routes now appear in the routing table.

Test by pinging SRV1 from PC1 again to verify the alternate path is used.

Learning Outcomes:
Understand the concept of floating static routes and how administrative distance impacts route selection.

Learn how to ensure network redundancy for enterprise connectivity.

Develop troubleshooting and route verification skills using ping, traceroute, and show ip route commands.
