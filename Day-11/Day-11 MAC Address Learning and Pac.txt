Day-11: MAC Address Learning and Packet Flow Lab – Packet Tracer Simulation

Objective:
Understand how MAC addresses are used and propagated through each segment of a network when a device sends a ping to another across multiple switches and routers.

Task Overview:
You are given a three-network segment topology (192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, and 192.168.3.0/24) interconnected through routers (R1, R2, and R3) and switches (SW1 and SW2), with end devices (PC1 to PC6) in different subnets.

Three Main Tasks:
1. PC1 pings PC4
Identify the Source and Destination MAC addresses at each hop during the ping from PC1 (192.168.1.1) to PC4 (192.168.3.1).
You need to find out the MAC addresses at these points:

A. PC1 → SW1

B. SW1 → R1

C. R1 → R2

D. R2 → R3

E. R3 → SW2

F. SW2 → PC4

Note: You should specify the MAC by the device and interface (e.g., R1 G0/0 MAC).

2. PC1 pings PC3
Find the MAC addresses at each point when PC1 sends a ping to PC3 (192.168.1.3) — a device within the same network, passing only through SW1.

A. PC1 → SW1

B. SW1 → PC3

3. PC4 pings PC1
Reverse the direction and identify the MAC addresses at each hop during a ping from PC4 to PC1.
This will follow the reverse path of Task 1 and should include similar segments.

Instructions:
• Use CLI and Simulation Mode in Cisco Packet Tracer to view each packet's journey.
• Complete an initial ping in Realtime mode to populate the ARP tables and enable MAC address learning.
• Switch to Simulation mode and filter ICMP packets to analyze each step clearly.

This activity helps reinforce concepts such as:

• MAC address learning
• ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
• Layer 2 vs Layer 3 communication
• How MAC addresses change at each hop across a routed network
