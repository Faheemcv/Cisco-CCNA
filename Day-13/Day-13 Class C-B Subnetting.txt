Day-13 Class C-B Subnetting 
Overview:

• IP Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
• Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 → /16
• Purpose: Class B addresses support medium-sized networks by default, with around 65,534 hosts per network.

Why Subnet Class B?
Even though Class B supports many hosts, sometimes you don’t need all of them in one network. Subnetting allows you to divide one large network into multiple smaller networks (subnets), improving management and security.

Example:
Let’s say you use a /24 subnet mask (255.255.255.0) instead of the default /16:

• New subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
• Borrowed bits: 8 bits from the host part
• Number of subnets: 2⁸ = 256 subnets
• Hosts per subnet: 2⁸ - 2 = 254 hosts

Class C Subnetting – Explained
Overview:
• IP Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
• Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 → /24
• Purpose: Class C addresses are designed for small networks, supporting 254 hosts per network.

Why Subnet Class C?
If you want to divide a small network into even smaller segments, like for departments or security reasons, you can subnet Class C further.

Example:
Use a /26 subnet mask (255.255.255.192):

• Borrowed bits: 2 bits from the host part
• Number of subnets: 2² = 4 subnets
• Hosts per subnet: 2⁶ - 2 = 62 hosts

Summary Table
Class	Default Subnet Mask	Hosts (Default)	Subnet Example	Hosts/Subnet
B	255.255.0.0 (/16)	65,534	        /24	        254
C	255.255.255.0 (/24)	254	        /26	        62
