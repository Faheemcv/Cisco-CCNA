Day-17: VLAN Configuration with Router-on-a-Stick Setup
This Packet Tracer network topology demonstrates VLAN segmentation, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing using router-on-a-stick configuration. The scenario includes two switches (SW1 and SW2), a router (R1), and multiple PCs grouped under three VLANs:

Network Components and Addressing:
VLAN 10 (Yellow)

• Subnet: 10.0.0.0/26

• PCs:

• PC1: 10.0.0.1
• PC2: 10.0.0.2
• PC6: 10.0.0.3
• PC7: 10.0.0.4

• VLAN 20 (Blue)

• Subnet: 10.0.0.64/26
• PC5: 10.0.0.65

• VLAN 30 (Purple)

• Subnet: 10.0.0.128/26

• Cs:

• PC3: 10.0.0.129
• PC4: 10.0.0.130

Configuration Tasks:
1. Switch Access Port Configuration:
   Assign the respective switch ports (F0/x) to the correct VLAN for each PC using      switchport access vlan <VLAN_ID>.

2. Trunk Link Between SW1 and SW2:

• Configure G0/1 on SW1 and G0/1 on SW2 as trunk ports using switchport mode trunk.

• Allow only VLANs 10, 20, and 30 using switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30.

• Assign an unused VLAN (e.g., VLAN 99) as the native VLAN to prevent VLAN hopping.

3. Router-on-a-Stick Setup:

• Use subinterfaces on R1’s G0/0 for inter-VLAN routing:

• G0/0.10 → VLAN 10 → IP: 10.0.0.62
• G0/0.20 → VLAN 20 → IP: 10.0.0.126
• G0/0.30 → VLAN 30 → IP: 10.0.0.190
• Assign encapsulation using encapsulation dot1Q <VLAN_ID>.

4.Connectivity Testing:

• Use the ping command from each PC to verify full connectivity across VLANs.
• Ensure that all PCs can reach each other, confirming successful inter-VLAN routing.

Final Outcome:
If configured correctly:

• All VLANs will be isolated at Layer 2.
• Inter-VLAN routing will occur via R1.
• All PCs from different VLANs will be able to communicate using the router-on-a-stick   approach.
