Day-16: VLAN Configuration & Inter-VLAN Routing Lab

Objective:

This lab is designed to teach VLAN configuration, IP addressing, and inter-VLAN routing using a router-on-a-stick setup in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is divided into three 
VLANs:

• VLAN10: Engineering (Subnet: 10.0.0.0/26)
• VLAN20: HR (Subnet: 10.0.0.64/26)
• VLAN30: Sales (Subnet: 10.0.0.128/26)

Each VLAN includes 2 PCs connected to a switch (SW1), which is in turn connected to a single router (R1).

Instructions Summary:
1. IP Address Configuration:

Assign correct IP addresses and subnet masks to each PC based on the VLAN they belong to.

Set the default gateway of each PC to the last usable IP address of its respective subnet:

VLAN10: Gateway = 10.0.0.62

VLAN20: Gateway = 10.0.0.126

VLAN30: Gateway = 10.0.0.190

Router Setup (Router-on-a-Stick):

Use one physical interface on the router (e.g., G0/1) and configure sub-interfaces for each VLAN.

Assign the respective gateway IP to each sub-interface.


interface G0/1.10
  encapsulation dot1Q 10
  ip address 10.0.0.62 255.255.255.192

interface G0/1.20
  encapsulation dot1Q 20
  ip address 10.0.0.126 255.255.255.192

interface G0/1.30
  encapsulation dot1Q 30
  ip address 10.0.0.190 255.255.255.192
Switch Configuration:

Create and name the VLANs:

vlan 10
  name Engineering
vlan 20
  name HR
vlan 30
  name Sales
Assign each switch port to its corresponding VLAN:

interface F3/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
...
Configure the router-facing port as a trunk:

interface G1/1
  switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
  switchport mode trunk
Testing Connectivity:

Use simulation mode in Packet Tracer.

Test ping between PCs in the same VLAN to ensure intra-VLAN communication.

Use broadcast ping (ping subnet broadcast address) to observe which PCs respond within the same VLAN.

Verify inter-VLAN routing by pinging PCs across different VLANs.

Purpose & Learning Outcome:
This lab demonstrates:

How to segment a network using VLANs.

How to configure a router to enable communication between VLANs.

Practical use of trunk links and sub-interfaces.

Use of Packet Tracer simulation to observe broadcast behavior and debug connectivity.
