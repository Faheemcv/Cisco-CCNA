Day-15: VLSM Subnetting & Static Routing Lab

Objective:
Use VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to divide the 192.168.5.0/24 network into multiple subnets based on the number of hosts in each LAN. Also, establish a point-to-point connection between two routers and configure static routes so all PCs can communicate.

Network Requirements:

LAN	No. of Hosts	Devices Involved	Subnet Type
LAN1	45 hosts	PC1, SW1	        Medium Subnet
LAN2	64 hosts	PC2, SW2	        Largest Subnet
LAN3	14 hosts	PC3, SW3	        Small Subnet
LAN4	9 hosts	        PC4, SW4	        Smallest Subnet
P2PLink	2 hosts	        Between R1 & R2	        Point-to-Point (/30)

Instructions:

1. Subnet the 192.168.5.0/24 address space using VLSM to meet the host requirements of all 4 LANs and 1 point-to-point link.

2. For each LAN:
• Assign the first usable IP address to the PC.
• Assign the last usable IP address to the router interface connected to that LAN.

3. For the point-to-point link, use a subnet that supports only 2 hosts (like /30).

4. Configure static routes on both routers (R1 and R2) so that:
• All PCs across LAN1 to LAN4 can ping each other.
• The routers can forward packets properly between networks.

Learning Outcomes:

• Understand how to apply VLSM in real-world topologies.
• Practice IP addressing with efficiency.
• Apply static routing to enable end-to-end connectivity.
• Reinforce subnet mask calculation and host address assignment.
