Day-9 Lab: Static Routing Configuration Lab

In this network topology, you are tasked with enabling communication between two PCs (PC1 and PC2) across three routers using static routing.

• There are three networks:

• 192.168.1.0/24 (PC1 and SW1)
• 192.168.3.0/24 (PC2 and SW2)
• 192.168.12.0/24 and 192.168.13.0/24 are used as inter-router links.

• Devices include:

• PC1 with IP 192.168.1.1, gateway 192.168.1.254
• PC2 with IP 192.168.3.1, gateway 192.168.3.254
• R1, R2, and R3 with IPs assigned as shown on the diagram

 Step-by-Step Configuration
 PC Configuration (example for PC1 and PC2)
 PC1:
  IP Address: 192.168.1.1
  Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
  Default Gateway: 192.168.1.254

 PC2:

  IP Address: 192.168.3.1
  Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
  Default Gateway: 192.168.3.254
 Router Interface IP Configuration
 R1
  enable
  conf t
  hostname R1
  interface g0/1
  ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
  exit
  interface g0/0
  ip address 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
  exit

R2
  enable
  conf t
  hostname R2
  interface g0/0
  ip address 192.168.12.2 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
  exit
  interface g0/1
  ip address 192.168.13.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
  exit

R3
  enable
  conf t
  hostname R3
  interface g0/0
  ip address 192.168.13.2 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
  exit
  interface g0/1
  ip address 192.168.3.254 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown
  exit

Static Routing Configuration
Add static routes to each router to ensure they know how to reach all networks.

R1:
  ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2

R2:
  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1
  ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2

R3:
  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.1
Testing
After configuring everything:

• Ping from PC1 to PC2 (ping 192.168.3.1)
• You should receive replies if routing is correctly set up.

 Summary:
This lab demonstrates:

• Basic IP addressing on PCs and routers.
• Configuring default gateways on PCs.
• Setting up static routes between routers.
•Testing end-to-end connectivity using ping.
