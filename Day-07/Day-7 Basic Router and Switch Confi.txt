Day-7: Basic Router and Switch Configuration Lab

Objective:
This lab focuses on configuring basic settings on a router and two switches, assigning IP addresses to PCs, configuring interface parameters, and improving network security and management by disabling unused ports and applying meaningful descriptions.

Network Details:

• IP Addressing Scheme: 172.16.0.0/16

• Devices:

• Router (R1) – Cisco 2911

• Switches (SW1 & SW2) – Cisco 2960-24TT

• PCs (PC1 to PC4) – PC-PT

Device	Interface	IP Address
R1	G0/0	        172.16.255.254
PC1	NIC	        172.16.0.1
PC2	NIC	        172.16.0.2
PC3	NIC	        172.16.0.3
PC4	NIC	        172.16.0.4

Physical Connections:

• R1 G0/0 to SW1 G0/1

• SW1 F0/1 to PC1

• SW1 F0/2 to PC2

• SW1 G0/2 to SW2 G0/1

• SW2 F0/1 to PC3

• SW2 F0/2 to PC4

Tasks to be Performed:

1. Configure Hostnames
Set the hostnames of the router and switches:

• Router → R1

• Switch 1 → SW1

• Switch 2 → SW2

2. Assign IP Addresses
Assign IP addresses as per the topology to:

• R1 (G0/0), and

• PCs (PC1–PC4)

3. Configure Interface Speed and Duplex (Manual)
For all switch-to-switch and switch-to-router interfaces (not PC connections), manually set:

• Speed to 1000 (or 100 if gigabit is not supported)

• Duplex to full

4. Interface Descriptions
On each switch and router interface, configure descriptions for easier identification.
Example:

interface G0/1  
  description Connection to SW1
  
5. Disable Unused Interfaces
On both switches and the router, shut down interfaces that are not connected to any device using:

interface [id]  
  shutdown

Purpose of the Lab:
This lab helps reinforce foundational configuration skills for Cisco networking devices including:

• IP addressing

• Physical interface management

• Switch and router security hygiene

• Interface-level documentation and management
