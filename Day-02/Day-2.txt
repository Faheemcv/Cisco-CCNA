Day 2 - Extended Network Cabling and Design Topology
This lab demonstrates an extended enterprise network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, integrating routers, switches, PCs, and a server in a multi-tiered architecture. The topology simulates a realistic scenario using appropriate cable types based on physical distance and connection type.

Devices Used:
4 × Cisco 2911 Routers (R1, R2, R3, R4)

8 × Cisco 2960 Switches (SW1 to SW8)

3 × PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3)

1 × Server (SRV1)

Key Connections & Cable Types:
R1 ↔ R2 (50m): Copper cable (Crossover if MDI-X disabled)

R1 ↔ R3 (3km): Fiber Optic – Single-Mode (suitable for long-distance backbone connection)

R3 ↔ R4 (250m): Fiber Optic – Multimode (used for medium distance)

R2 ↔ SW1/SW2, R4 ↔ SW5/SW6: Copper Ethernet cables (Crossover or Straight-through based on port configuration)

SW1 ↔ SW2, SW5 ↔ SW6: Inter-switch links

SW3/SW4/SW7/SW8 ↔ PCs/Server: Ethernet cables (Straight-through)

Learning Objectives:
Apply correct cable types based on device and distance (Copper, Single-mode, Multimode Fiber)

Practice manual cabling with Auto MDI-X disabled

Design scalable hierarchical topologies (core, distribution, access layers)

Understand physical limitations and practical cabling rules in enterprise networking
