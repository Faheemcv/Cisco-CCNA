IPv4 Address Classes & Subnetting

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers divided into 5 classes (A to E) based on their starting bits and range.

Class	Starting Bits	Range (First Octet)	Default Subnet Mask	Usage
A	0	        1 – 126	                255.0.0.0	        Large networks
B	10	        128 – 191	        255.255.0.0	        Medium networks
C	110	        192 – 223  	        255.255.255.0	        Small networks
D	1110	        224 – 239	        -	                Multicast
E	1111	        240 – 255	        -	                Reserved for research

Note: 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback testing.

Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets).

Purpose of Subnetting:

• Improve network performance
• Increase security
• Efficient IP address usage

Key Terms:

• Subnet Mask: Used to separate the network and host parts of an IP address.

• CIDR Notation: e.g., /24 (means 24 bits for the network).

• Network Address: The first address in the subnet (used to identify the subnet).

• Broadcast Address: The last address in the subnet (used to send data to all hosts).

Example:

• IP: 192.168.1.10

• Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 or /24

• Network Address: 192.168.1.0

• Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255

• Usable Hosts: 254 (from .1 to .254)
